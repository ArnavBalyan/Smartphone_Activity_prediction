# Smartphone_Activity_prediction
Predict the human activity by users on smartphones. Various algorithms were used, best results were ontained from K nearest neighbours (~90%).
The next activity of user is predicted from the previous activities of user in the smartphone.

KNN works by finding the distances between a query and all the examples in the data, selecting the specified number examples (K) closest to the query, then votes for the most frequent label (in the case of classification) or averages the labels (in the case of regression)

The accuracies can be enhanced using Neural Networks. Feel free to contribute to this by improving the accuracies.
